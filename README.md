Hello! 

My name is Alex, and I'm looking forward to contributing to many projects here.

Right now, I'm diving into the world of object-oriented programming, web development, and databases at Tech Elevator. 

I've dabbled in Python but am set on becoming Java fluent at the moment.‚òï

Feel free to ask about anything I may be working on. I'd love to collaborate! üçª
