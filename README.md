# Hi, I'm Alex Bogden ðŸ’»

Iâ€™m a career transitioner into software development, building on a background in marketing, communications, and data annotation.  
After graduating from Tech Elevatorâ€™s full-stack Java bootcamp, Iâ€™ve been focused on backend programming, REST APIs, and relational databases, while continuing to grow in full-stack development.  

Lately, Iâ€™ve been working on personal projects like **TrendTap** (a YouTube-powered content insights app), practicing advanced Java through daily katas, and exploring ways to apply coding skills in data annotation and AI evaluation work.
